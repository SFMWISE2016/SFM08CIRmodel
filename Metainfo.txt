Datafile: yield_CN1year0616.txt : 'text file for the 1-year yield to maturity of China's treasury bond.'

Input: yield_CN1year0616 : 'text file for the 1-year yield to maturity of China's treasury bond.'

Output: 'MLE estimates of the parameters of the CIR model using 1-year yield to maturity of China's treasure bond; the simulated short rate series (figure1); the term structure given different short rate (figure2, figure3 and figure4).'
